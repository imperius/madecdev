If you are reading this, it means that supervisord is installed and you have to use it.

ATTENTION: use standard start command ($ bin/instance start, $ bin/zeo-server start ...)
           only for debug purpose, not in the standard operation mode.

Start all
=========

Use the bin/supervisord-init script to start the entire system (zeo, instances, solr ...) and
the supervisord itself; this because you can stop the supervisord script only by killing it.
Supervisord start automatically only the porcesses with the attribute autostart set to true.


Check status
============

To check which process is up and if there is a problem, use this command:

$ bin/supervisorctl status


Handle single porcess
=====================

To start/stop a sigle process, use the syntax like this:

$ bin/supervisorctl start instance
$ bin/supervisorctl stop instance

if supervisord is up you can start/stop all processes with this command:

$ bin/supervisorctl start all
$ bin/supervisorctl stop all
